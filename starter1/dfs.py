"""
An example of depth first search through a graph.

Note: stepping through a debug session in VSCode may be helpful here.

Sources:

Challenge problems:
 - Change the source node (the node to start at) for either of the functions to
   one that we haven't tried, and without running the code try to predict what
   the function will return. You can do this by either tracing through the code,
   or figure it out from your understanding of DFS.
 - Update both DFS functions to take in a parameter specifying a value to find
   in the graph. The updated functions should return `True` if the value is
   found, and `False` if not.

    We will treat this list like a stack, and use it to store the nodes we need

    A stack is a First-in Last-out (FILO) data structure. You can add items to
    it and remove items from it. The first item to get added is the last item to
    be removed. You can think of it like a stack of plates, if you stack 3
    plates on top of each other, the first one to be removed from that stack
    will be the last plate you added.
    
    The stack data structure is useful for DFS because we want to traverse down
    an entire path of nodes, and only after we can go no further do we want to
    come back up.
